    "Overall these exercises were pretty straightforward for me. I have some Pyhton experience and classify myself as an advanced beginner so all of this was review. I will say that question 2.10 took me quite some extra time. This is because I defined \"int\" as an integer earlier in the notebook so once I tried utilizing the int() function python was throwing up an error signal. Once I renamed the int variable to something else everything worked fine relating to 2.10.  "

    "### Thoughts on this question\n",
    "   To be honest this question was interesting to me regarding the highest number of digits a python integer could be. My initial thought was this question is kinda nonsense as from a practical point of view as a \"finance\" question the absolute highest number we could deal with would be the value of all the assets and money in the world which seems to be a 500 trillion dollar mark (being extrememly generous here). The value of 500 trillion has 15 digits meaning any value in python over 15 digits sees \"overkill\". However, after testing 10^10000, an error message turned up with the limit seeming to be 4300 digits. I have no idea how this 4300 limit was made but I am confident that it is overkill for 99.9% of python users!"
