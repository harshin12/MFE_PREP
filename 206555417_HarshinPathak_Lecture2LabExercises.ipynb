    "In this question I utilized nested for loops to print out certain asterisks patterns. The basic pattern was to iterate through a dataset 10 times. The key is to have the dataset values either increase by 1: ex (1,2,3,4...,9,10) or decrase by 1: ex (10,9,8...,2,1). Based on this template pattern, I added complexity regarding initial spaces for patterns C and D.  \n"

    "The main thing that I learned regarding Anscombe's Quartet was the reinforcement of the principle: \"Correlation is not caustation\". Anscombes Quartet reminded me of this as the 4 datasets based on descriptive statistics (linear regression eqn, std deviation, mean values) should be the same but are not. This is because similar to the principle of \"correlation is not causation\", trends and insights from data need to be scrutined beyond face value. In conclusion, in this age of mass data and generative AI, Anscombes Quartet reminds me to scrutinze data, and be wary of generalizations at face value.\n"

    "The descriptive statistic I believe that can be useful for categorical variables is mode. Mode is useful because just as in a quantatative dataset, the categorical variable that shows up the most in a dataset can be useful in describing the dataset. For instance if we had a dataset of all dogs available in the USA, wouldn't the dog type most available be a good statistic to have? The other two descriptive statistics dont make too much sense to me. First of all, the mean of categorical values makes no sense at all. Similarly, the median categorical value of a dataset makes no sense unless the categorical dataset is structured in a time dependent manner. "
